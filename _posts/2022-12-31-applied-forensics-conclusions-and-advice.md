When reproducing the analysis I recommend different approaches based on the kind
of project you are looking at.

## You are Actively Working in an Established Project

If you are familiar with the team already, you might want to see where the most
impact can be made first. In this case I recommend to follow [Adam Tornhill's
Structure in Your Code as a Crime
Scene](https://pragprog.com/titles/atcrime/your-code-as-a-crime-scene/) (see
section **Contents & Extracts on the linked page).

## You are Evaluating Whether to Adopt or Contribute to an Open Source Project

In this case you might be interested most in the development activity. Thus,
I recommend starting by analysing the development cycles and main authors.

Then judge whether the project activity gives you the required confidence to
invest more time.

Next you can follow [Adam Tornhill's Structure in Your Code as a Crime
Scene](https://pragprog.com/titles/atcrime/your-code-as-a-crime-scene/) (see
section **Contents & Extracts on the linked page).
