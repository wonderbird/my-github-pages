# Contributing

To contribute to this page you need to build it locally.

## Prerequisites

* Install Jekyll

## Build and Preview

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You can preview the current site on http://localhost:4000 . Jekyll will detect when changes are saved and rebuild the page. You'll need to reload the page then.
