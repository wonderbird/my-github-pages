## Perl

In the past I have used Perl just very rarely. When working on a project larger than just a single small script, I have used a Dev Container in Visual Studio Code to get a decent development environment:

- [Create a development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container)
- [Example: Perl Dev Container](https://github.com/wonderbird/cloc/tree/add-xplusplus-support/.devcontainer)
