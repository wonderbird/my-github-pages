# Delphi

## Download and Install

To learn and get started with Delphi you can use the [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter/free-download?aldSet=en-GB).

## Getting Started

* [Learn to Program with Delphi Community Edition: Part 2 - Building and Debugging](https://community.embarcadero.com/blogs/entry/Learn-DelphiCE-Part2) - Learn basic Delphi by writing a simple calculator.

## Visual Studio Code Plugins

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an alternative to using the Embarcadero RAD Studio code editor.

The following extensions are useful:

- [Pascal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.pascal) - Note the extension's instructions on installing dependencies.
- [Pascal-Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.pascal-formatter) - installs automatically together with [Pascal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.pascal).

Apart from that, refer to the language agnostic extensions in [Visual Studio Code Plugins](../plugins/vs-code-plugins.html)


## Questions

While learning Delphi I have encountered the following questions:

Q: Does Delphi have a Garbage Collector? Why do I have to call `<MyObjectInstance>.Free()` in a `TForm.FormDestroy` method? (see section "Wiring the Buttons to the Code" in [Learn to Program with Delphi Community Edition: Part 5 - Putting the Calculator Together](https://community.embarcadero.com/blogs/entry/Learn-DelphiCE-Part5))
