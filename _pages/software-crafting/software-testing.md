## Research on TDD

  __Why Research on Test-Driven Development is Inconclusive?__ in Proceedings
  of the 14th ACM / IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software
  Engineering and Measurement (ESEM) (ESEM '20). Association for Computing
  Machinery, New York, NY, USA, Article 25, 1â€“10. 2020. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3382494.3410687

    * this current **meta** study is somewhat pessimistic about the current state of research
    * use this study as a starting point for further research

  of the Test-Driven Development Process: Does It Really Matter to
  Test-First or to Test-Last?"__ in IEEE Transactions on Software

    * "Conclusion: The claimed benefits of TDD may not be due to its distinctive test-first dynamic, but rather due to the fact that TDD-like processes encourage fine-grained, steady steps that improve focus and flow."
