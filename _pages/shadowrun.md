# Shadowrun

## How I Prepare a Scene

1. Find a source of inspiration, e.g. a source book or do an internet search for technical drawings, architecture sketches, rendered maps, etc.
1. Draw the scene in [DungeonDraft](https://dungeondraft.net/)
1. Export the drawing as **Universal VTT**. Grid off, Lighting on, Brightness 100%, Focus 100%, Overlay Level 100%, Camera Filter None, Grid Presets Custom, Grid PPI 100 pixels.
1. Import the drawing into [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/). Use the [Universal Battlemap Importer](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dd-import/) module for importing the scene. Image Type / Extension **webp**.
1. Populate your map in Foundry VTT.

At this point you have a map. If you have added walls, doors and windows in DungeonDraft already, then these should work in Foundry VTT.

  - Shadowrun Missions / SRM00-01 *Death of a Fixer* (Season 1, mission 1) is a way to bring player characters together.
