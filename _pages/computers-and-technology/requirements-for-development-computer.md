## Hardware

- >= 32 GB RAM
- >= 4 CPU cores
- Must support the following operating systems and programs
  - Windows 10, macOS X, Linux (a current kernel; supporting the latest compilers and development libraries; similar to Ubuntu latest)
  - Docker (i.e. nested virtualization / ability to create virtual machines inside)
