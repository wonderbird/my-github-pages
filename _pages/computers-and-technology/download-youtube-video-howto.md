# Download YouTube Video HOWTO

To download a YouTube video to your disk for offline viewing, follow the instructions described in [wikiHow: Herunterladen von Youtube Videos](https://de.wikihow.com/Herunterladen-von-Youtube-Videos) (in German).

As of January 2024

- method #1 [4K Video Downloader+](https://www.4kdownload.com/products/videodownloader-42) works for me (it can be installed via homebrew),
- method #3 VLC does not work any longer.

## Caveat

Downloading specific music or videos may be against the law (copyright, intellectual property). Please be sure that you have the necessary license or agreement by the owner. Otherwise you may be sued because of violating copyright laws.
