# XBox Game Controllers on a Mac

In combination with the [C64](c64.html) and [Amiga Emulator](https://fs-uae.net) I am using an XBox game controller and an XBox 360 game controller as a joystick replacement on macOS Catalina. The following links show how you can connect such devices and how you can reconfigure them to emit keyboard keys instead of joystick axis movements. This allows to control games with the game pad instead of the keyboard.

- [macOS Catalina Driver for the XBox 360 Controller](https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller)
  - How-To Geek: [How to Connect an Xbox One Controller to Your Mac](https://www.howtogeek.com/393335/how-to-connect-an-xbox-one-controller-to-your-mac/)<br>*tested on macOS Catalina; most probably does not work on Big Sure and newer*
  
- [CarvWare](http://www.carvware.com) *allows to map the gamepad to keyboard strokes and key sequences*
